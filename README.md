# Honda-Light-Controller
This is the source code for controlling the rgb lights in my 92 accord. This is an old project that I have uploaded to GitHub and updated. This project controls the RGB led strips by keeping the count of button presses in the 'state' variable. The lights are only controlled from one button in the car's dash. The ATtiny85 this circut was designed for only has two PWM pins so my color choices are more limited.
